# UCLA_HW2_AdvCSS_Portfolio
The purpose of this assignment was to begin creative a porfolio for our work.  
The website needed feture different sections, a nav bar that linked with its respective section, a photo avatar and that it would resize for different sized screens. 

# What I built:
I started off with a totally different design and color scheme, which I worked on a few times to get to where I am now. 
My website features a background image that spands the entire length and purspoly spans a certain wideth as to not interfere with the text or images. 
I created a header which follows you as you scroll down the page.  
Additionally, the nav bar on the top right corner links to its respective areas and also includes a direct link to one of my social media platforms that is most used.
The about me section has a small description of my backfround and goals along with a photo that was sized and designed in PhotoShop. 
Next, you will scroll down to my Wok section, where you will find three placeholder projects.  Each image has been modified and sized in PS for the site. 
When hovering over an image, the image will grow, depending on which one you are hovered over.
Scroll down more and you reach the contact me section which includes an icon of a paper airplne that signifies email, which is clickable and brings up the useres 
email port.  My email is automatically placed in the 'Sent-to' section of said email.  

Lastly, you reach the resume section where you are told that my resume is available upon request.  Which hopefully is a call to action to press the email button above. 


# Overall 
Overall, I liked this project a lot.  I had fun being creative and although it took me a long time to do, there felt like there was a lot of growth in my undertanding for HTML and CSS.  I have a lot to work on to get this to where I truly would like it to be, but I'm pretty happy with it so far.
